Please see UCSD Online for the assignment specifics, and the class website for details on the acceleration structure and extra credit.  Please submit to the feedback servers on UCSD Online before you submit to Canvas.  

You should submit a zip file of your entire source code directory. The zip file should contain a README file with the following entries:

(1) Your name (and your partner's name if working in a group of two, otherwise clarify you are working alone).

Valli Nachiappan, Ryan Paquia

(2) Your UCSD online username and e-mail used. (If using single sign-on, simply enter your official UCSD email)

vnachiap@ucsd.edu

(3) The image-grader URL for full-res images on UCSD online.

(4) The platform your code supports and any specific compilation instructions.

Visual Studio Code on Windows

(5) [Optional] Link (URL) to a website which has images and documentation of your raytracer (but please do not post source code publicly on the site).  This website is required if you want extra credit.  Please do not modify it after you submit the assignment.

We only put in our currently passing test cases in our website. This doesn't affect the Academic Integrity policy because this is a private website link that can only be accessed using this link, and no future student can access the website through any search engine. 

PDF Link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c4JlHD4eMzvk6LtxqXLvTMGCUiPVKiQdfPps1_hFhFs/edit?usp=sharing

We also have this PDF outlining our entire raytracing implementation process (no source code). Even though we didn't have time to implement any additional cool scenes, we hope this will help us get some extra credit (also on the website). Thank you!! 


(6) Any special comments, issues or points in grading or generally about the assignment you want to convey.  For this assignment, you should at least describe the acceleration structure you use (if you implemented one), and point to any images/documentation/timings showing it works [timings can just be included in the README, ideally images and documentation would go on your website above]. 

Our final images for all the test scenes are in a zip files called "hw3.zip" in the top level of this file (same location as this README). 

One small comment is that our scene 7 is very close to passing the image grader, it is only 1075/1000 pixels different than the solution image. This is a very small margin of error, and we hope it'll still be okay because our image is very close to the solution image except for a few tiny spots.

We tried to implement the Octree acceleration feature, but we are having some implementation issues. However we have the code for it written, even though it doesn't fully work! We would appreciate any partial credit for attempting it! We also documented our entire ray tracer process with intermediate image outputs for most of the steps, this doesn't include any source code at all. We hope this can satisfy the extra credit requirement even though we weren't able to test out and render any additional cool scenes.  

Please make sure to include all of the above information.
